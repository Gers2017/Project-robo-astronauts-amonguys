# Robo-astronauts-vs-amonguys

### What is this project
Robo Astronauts vs Amonguys is a game made in 20 days approximately and made for the [GameOff 2020 jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020).
The game originally was conceived as a 2d roguelike in a lunar station.
But after taking the decision to learn blender the game turned into a third person shooter (I didn't have any experience on third person shooters).

The 3d models of the rocks, spaceship, buildings, fences and platforms are from the [Space kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-kit) made by [Kenney](https://twitter.com/KenneyNL).

### Can you learn from this code? 
In a few words I would say no. There are some scripts like the Object Pooler which is great to reuse and improve but that's no the case with all the code. 
As you may know sometimes there's no time to think about the perfect and clever way to solve a problem. In that case you would use **temporal code** (code that you'll never touch again). And that's why I said you should learn from that kind of code.

### Can I use the scripts and models?
To that I would say **yes, if you're not planning use in a commercial project**

### Can I contribute to the project?
Sure. Any contribution is appreciated.
